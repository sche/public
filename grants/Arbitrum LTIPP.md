# SECTION 2a: Team and Product Information

## Team Experience

Our team boasts extensive technical expertise, with a proven track record of contributing to Open Source projects and delivering successful endeavors such as Gnosis Safe Mobile.

Our team's vision for Goverland is to democratize governance for DAO participants, fostering increased participation rates and enhancing delegate accountability.

## Product Features:

In our forthcoming public release, Goverland will introduce a host of user-friendly features tailored to DAO participants:

- **Subscription Services**: Users can opt-in to receive push notifications for key DAO updates, including:
  - New proposals
  - Quorum achievements
  - Voting reminders as deadlines approach
  - Final voting outcomes

- **DAO Insights**: Our platform will provide valuable analytics, such as:
  - Success rates of proposals
  - Monthly active voters
  - Voting frequency among users
  - Top voters ranked by average voting power

- **Voting Accessibility**: Users can conveniently participate in voting processes, initially through Snapshot, ensuring on-the-go engagement with governance activities.

These features collectively aim to streamline the user experience, promote informed decision-making, and foster a more robust and engaged DAO community.

### Bringing ArbitrumDAO On-Chain Voting Experience to Goverland App

ArbitrumDAO stands as one of the largest DAOs, boasting approximately [~60K monthly active voting addresses on Snapshot](https://dune.com/queries/3480528/5849863) and [~20K monthly active voting addresses on-chain](https://dune.com/queries/3480520/5849859), primarily utilizing Tally's web interface.

Presently, ArbitrumDAO participants navigate through multiple platforms to engage in full-cycle governance, including the ArbitrumDAO forum, Snapshot for off-chain voting, and Tally interface for on-chain voting. 

Through the Goverland Mobile App, we aim to streamline this process by consolidating vital information into one accessible platform, providing users with a seamless governance experience on mobile devices.

In this grant proposal, we seek support to integrate ArbitrumDAO's on-chain voting experience into the Goverland App, thus enhancing accessibility and user engagement within the DAO's governance processes.

### Novelty and Innovation

Goverland introduces a groundbreaking mobile experience for voters within the largest Snapshot DAO with on-chain governance, ArbitrumDAO, revolutionizing accessibility and convenience for participants.

### Composability with Other Projects

Our project embraces composability, as many components delivered will be open-sourced, facilitating seamless integration of on-chain governance into Goverland for other DAOs within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

### Retention Measurement

Internally, we employ metrics to track and visualize returning DAO voters, with our primary KPIs focused on increasing core user retention and enhancing token holder participation rates.

### Relevant Usage Metrics

As the App is not yet public at the time of this grant application, relevant usage metrics will be collected and analyzed post-launch.

### Team-Controlled Wallets and Incentives

Not applicable

### Utilization of Third-Party Consultants

No, we did not utilize grants consultants or any other third-party entities in the drafting of this proposal.

## SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILS

### Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?

No, our open-source infrastructure is designed to be generic-purpose for all types of DAOs. However, custom integration is required for large DAOs like Arbitrum that utilize a custom implementation of on-chain voting.

### On what other networks is the protocol deployed?

Currently, we only support off-chain voting using Snapshot.

### What date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?

Not relevant to our current stage.

### Do you have a native token?

No, there are no plans for a native token at this time.

### Past Incentivization

Not applicable; we have not previously run any liquidity mining or incentive programs.

### Current Incentivization

There are no current incentivization programs in place.

### Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program?

No, we have not received any grants from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem-related programs.

### Protocol Performance

As we are not public yet, performance metrics are not available.

### Protocol Roadmap

Our roadmap includes:

- Integration of first DAO on-chain voting: 3 months after the public launch.
- Future plans dependent on feature priorities:
  - Support for more on-chain DAOs.
  - Introduction of DAO delegates and delegate accountability features.
  - Development of an Android App.

### Audit History & Security Vendors

Not applicable at this time.

### Security Incidents

There have been no security incidents to report.
