# SECTION 2a: Team and Product Information

## Team Experience

Our team boasts extensive technical expertise, with a proven track record of contributing to Open Source projects and delivering successful endeavors such as Gnosis Safe Mobile.

Our team's vision for Goverland is to democratize governance for DAO participants, fostering increased participation rates and enhancing delegate accountability.

## Product Features:

Our public release will be in April. With the full support of Snapshot protocol voting initially, with the help of this grant, we will add support of Arbitrum DAO on-chain voting on iOS and iPadOS happening on the Arbitrum chain within 12 weeks while the grant program runs.

### Features avaialble during the public laucnh in April:

- **Notifications**: Users can opt-in to receive push notifications for key DAO updates, including:
  - New proposals
  - Proposals quorum achievements
  - Voting reminders as deadlines approach
  - Final voting outcomes

- **DAO Insights**: Our platform will provide valuable analytics, such as:
  - Success rates of proposals
  - Monthly active voters
  - Voting frequency among users
  - Top voters ranked by average voting power

- **Voting Accessibility**: Users can conveniently participate in voting processes using mobile devices, ensuring on-the-go engagement with governance activities.

These features collectively aim to streamline the user experience, promote informed decision-making, and foster a more robust and engaged DAO community.

### Why bring ArbitrumDAO On-Chain Voting Experience to mobile

ArbitrumDAO stands as one of the largest DAOs, boasting approximately [~60K monthly active voting addresses on Snapshot](https://dune.com/queries/3480528/5849863) and [~20K monthly active voting addresses on-chain](https://dune.com/queries/3480520/5849859).

Presently, ArbitrumDAO participants navigate through multiple platforms to engage in full-cycle governance, including the ArbitrumDAO forum, Snapshot for off-chain voting, and Tally interface for on-chain voting. 

Through the Goverland Mobile App, we aim to streamline this process by consolidating vital information into one accessible platform, providing users with a seamless governance experience on mobile devices.

In this grant proposal, we seek support to integrate ArbitrumDAO's on-chain voting experience into the Goverland App.

### Novelty and Innovation

Goverland introduces a groundbreaking mobile experience for voters within the largest Snapshot DAO with on-chain governance, ArbitrumDAO, revolutionizing accessibility and convenience for participants.

### Composability with Other Projects

Our project embraces composability, as many components delivered will be open-sourced, facilitating seamless integration of on-chain governance into Goverland for other DAOs within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

### Retention Measurement

We visualize new and returning DAO users inside the App and voters' participation frequency.

### Relevant Usage Metrics

To measure the positive outcome this grant results, we will visualize the following usage metrics:
- Percentage of voting power participating in Snapshot/On-chain voting.
- Percentage of token holders participating in Snapshot/On-chain voting.
- Distribution of votes across different interfaces.
- Voter retention rate.
- Identifying the top voters based on average voting power over the last six months.

### Team-Controlled Wallets and Incentives

Not applicable

### Utilization of Third-Party Consultants

No, we did not utilize grants consultants or any other third-party entities in the drafting of this proposal.

## SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILS

### Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?

ArbtirumDAO on-chain voting using Governor contract modification is native to Arbitrum. We don't own the voting protocol, but we build a convenient mobile app that brings more users and usage to the network.

Our open-source infrastructure is designed to be generic-purpose for all types of DAOs. However, custom integration is required for large DAOs like Arbitrum that utilize a custom implementation of on-chain voting.

### On what other networks is the protocol deployed?

ArbtirumDAO voting is on the Arbitrum network.
The Goverland Mobile App supports off-chain voting using Snapshot only at the moment.

### Do you have a native token?

No, there are no plans for Goverland native token at this time.

### Past Incentivization

No.

### Current Incentivization

No.

### Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program?

No.

### Protocol Performance
